    <h2 class="hidden">About</h2>
    <p class="text_column">The companies that have made a name for themselves in the cryptocurrency market have mainly been companies that provide wallets/exchanges and those that mine. Wallet companies such as <i>Coinbase</i> have made the experience extremely user-friendly. It reminds me of the <i>Robinhood</i> app used for stock trading by giving people interested a means of participating. </p>
	  
    <p class="text_column">The only <i>lock-in</i> I see is how users become experienced with a platform and then want "repeated experiences" with that same user interface or possibly that a platform only supports few cryptocurrencies which lock you into those. I would recommend diversifying coins and experimenting with alt-coins as there have a larger potential to increase but are riskier.   </p>
	  
    <p class="text_column">Mining is interesting as once set up it is a passive income. Fixed costs can be cover in a few months as long as electricity is reasonable. I will only recommend it if you are getting a separate computer dedicated to mining with a graphics card specifically for mining. </p>

      <h3>GROWTH</h3>

      <p>There is a growing opinion that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are "made out of thin air" and therefore hold no inherent value. After my research I find this statement to be incorrect. There are maybe fewer people that would accept cryptocurrency as payment; however, among the people using it, it has become increasingly valuable. You cannot put a price on anonymity. </p>

      <p>It is impossible to say with certainty that we are not in a "bubble." Bitcoin among other coins are in the "early adoption" phase, and the increase in users will only contribute positively to its value. It is tough to predict the future as there are no nations or companies to base expectations in the way the U.S. dollar and economy are correlated</p>
