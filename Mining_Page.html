    <p class="text_column">Cryptocurrency mining has grown exponentially over the past two years. To mine cryptocurrencies, all you need is a computer. Factors that differentiate an amateur miner from companies that mine as a business is the sheer computing power. About every four years, the number of bitcoins mined daily cuts in half. Currently, about 1800 BTC are mined a day, and this number is expected to drop to zero by 2040. Cryptography is the backbone of the blockchain that powers Bitcoin; therefore the more coins mined, the harder it becomes.    </p>
    <p class="text_column">China is a major player in the bitcoin mining business, reportedly mining about 60% of all new bitcoins in the world. The main reason the five largest cryptocurrency mining countries are in China is due to electricity costs. Electricity is cheaper in China relative to most places in the world and the main determinant in whether or not cryptocurrency mining is profitable. 
    </p>
    <p class="text_column">In most cases around the world, it is not profitable. This gives the advantage to larger companies who can benefit from <i><strong> economies of scale</strong></i> by cramming as many processors into a building as possible. This helps cut down on fixed costs for each additional unit of processing power to ensure profitability by maintaining as wide of a margin possible between electricity costs and coins mined. <i><strong> First Mover Advantage</strong></i> also plays a huge role as the earlier you get in to mining, the more profitable it is. </p>

      <p>Genesis mining is the largest miner of Ethereum in the world. They are based in Iceland and have been around since the end of 2013. Genesis earns money by providing computing power for the ethereum blockchain. Fractions of ethereum are "mined" by confirming transactions for the public ledger. In other words, by solving cryptic puzzles to legitimize blockchain transactions between users, companies like Genesis earn a small tax from users.   </p>
